A simple game I built along the course of learning Web-Dev.
A simple game I built along the course of learning Web-Dev.

The rules of the game are simple.

At the top of your window you'll be given the rgb value of a color. 
You'll have to guess the colour by clicking on the square of the same color. 
You can choose easy or hard difficulty. 
Easy difficulty will give you a choice of 3 squares while the hard difficulty will give you a choice of 6 squares.
